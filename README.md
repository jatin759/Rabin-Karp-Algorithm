Task
---------------------------------------
You task is to implement the Rabin­Karp algorithm using: 

(1) all four hash codes  
(Integer casting, Component sum, Polynomial sum, Cyclic sum) and 

(2) all three hash  
functions (Division, MAD, Multiplication). You can use linear probing to handle  
collisions. For each of the cases above (there will be 12), count: 
* False positives. The number of times hash value matches but not the actual  
string. 
* Comparisons: The number of string comparisons including the one’s that return  
true. 
Input will be given as a raw text file. The pattern will be given to you during the demo.  
The output should be two 4X3 matrices. You should display as well as store the results  
in a file named EntryNumOutput1.txt. 
 
Modify the the above algorithm (and program) to be able to search for  
incomplete words. You would like to type in something like ?orcius and have the  program match this pattern quickly to the correct answer Porcius. 

Follow the below instructions.

STEP1:
Open the terminal 

STEP2:
Move to the correct directory .

STEP3:
Write the command 'make'
->it will compile all the 2 (q1.cpp, q2.cpp) files
->and make 2 executable files namely:
->'ques1'
->'ques2'

STEP4:
Run the desired executable file with command './quesa' (where a=1,2)

STEP5:
Second program will give the output on terminal, while First program will make the output txt files as '2015csb1014-output1' 


NOTE : To run the code first add the desired input files in the same folder and name the input file in the programme accordingly.
And for second programme give the desired input in terminal.
